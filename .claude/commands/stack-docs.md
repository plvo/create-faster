description: Document a stack, database, or ORM in create-faster MDX docs
---

Systematically document stacks, databases, or ORMs following the `documenting-stack` skill.

This command will guide you through:
- Analyzing template files to identify what we create
- Structuring documentation with required sections
- Focusing on technical changes (files added/modified)
- Highlighting create-faster's mini configs and optimizations
- Creating clear file tree structures
- Documenting ORM/database integrations

**Core principle:** Document OUR additions, link to THEIR docs.

**Output:** Clean MDX documentation focused on what create-faster adds beyond official setup.
