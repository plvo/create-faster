title: Getting Started
description: create-faster is a modern CLI scaffolding tool that generates production-ready full-stack projects with multiple framework combinations. Unlike traditional scaffolding tools, create-faster enables you to create multiple applications simultaneously with automatic monorepo orchestration.
---

import { Tabs, Tab } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';


## Quick Start

<Tabs items={['bun', 'npm', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab value="bun">
    ```bash
    bunx create-faster
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npx create-faster
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm dlx create-faster
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Multi-App Support

The defining feature of create-faster is its ability to scaffold multiple applications in a single command. The CLI automatically determines whether to use a standard structure or Turborepo based on the number of applications.

**Single application** (enter `1`):

```bash
◇  How many apps do you want to create?
│  1

# Result: Standard framework structure
my-app/
└─ src/
```

**Multiple applications** (enter `2` or more):

```bash
◇  How many apps do you want to create?
│  3

# Result: Automatic Turborepo configuration
my-saas/
├─ apps/
│  ├─ web/
│  ├─ mobile/
│  └─ api/
└─ packages/
```

Need a Next.js frontend, an Expo mobile app, and a Hono backend? Simply specify 3 apps and create-faster handles the monorepo orchestration automatically.

## Two Ways to Create Projects

### Interactive Mode

Run the CLI without flags for a guided experience with prompts:

```bash
bunx create-faster
```

The interactive CLI walks you through:
- Project and app naming
- Stack selection (Next.js, Expo, Hono)
- Module configuration (UI libraries, authentication, data fetching, etc.)
- Database and ORM setup
- Development tools (Biome, Git, Husky)
- Dependency installation

### Non-Interactive Mode

Use CLI flags for automation and reproducibility:

```bash
bunx create-faster my-saas \
  --app web:nextjs:shadcn,tanstack-query \
  --app mobile:expo:nativewind \
  --app api:hono \
  --database postgres \
  --orm drizzle \
  --git \
  --pm bun \
  --extras biome,husky
```

After each project generation, create-faster displays a copy-paste ready command to recreate the exact configuration.

## Philosophy

create-faster draws inspiration from established tools like create-t3-app and better-t-stack while addressing a specific gap: modern full-stack development often requires multiple applications working together.

Rather than enforcing strict conventions, create-faster provides sensible production-ready defaults and handles the complexity of multi-app integration. The tool focuses on:

- **Flexibility**: Choose only what you need
- **Scale**: Single app or multi-app architecture
- **Integration**: Pre-configured compatibility between stacks
- **Modularity**: Opt-in features without bloat
- **Currency**: Modern, actively maintained dependencies

Each framework follows its own standard conventions while benefiting from shared infrastructure when using Turborepo.
