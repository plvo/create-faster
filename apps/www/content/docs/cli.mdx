The interactive CLI provides a guided experience for creating projects. Run the command without any flags to start:

```bash
# With your favorite package manager
npx create-faster
pnpm dlx create-faster
bunx create-faster
```

## Workflow Overview

The CLI walks through configuration in a logical sequence, starting with naming decisions, then application setup, followed by infrastructure choices, and finally installation preferences.

## Step-by-Step Process

<Steps>

<Step>

### Project Name

First, you'll name your project:

```
┌  create-faster
│
◇  Name of your project?
│  my-saas
```

The CLI validates that no file or directory with this name exists in the current directory. For single-app projects, this name becomes the application directory. For multi-app projects, it becomes the monorepo root.

</Step>

<Step>

### Application Count

Next, specify how many applications to create:

```
◇  How many apps do you want to create?
│  Eg: a backend + a frontend = enter 2
│  Only a Next.js app = enter 1
│  Turborepo will be used if more than one
│  3
```

**Single app (1)**: Generates a standard framework project structure.

**Multiple apps (2+)**: Automatically configures Turborepo with apps in `apps/` directory and shared packages in `packages/`.

</Step>

<Step>

### App Configuration

For each application, you'll configure its name, stack, and modules.

#### App Name

For single-app projects, the app name matches the project name automatically. For multi-app projects, you'll name each application:

```
◇  Name of the app #1?
│  web

◇  Name of the app #2?
│  mobile

◇  Name of the app #3?
│  api
```

#### Stack Selection

Choose the framework for each app:

```
◇  Select the stack for web
│  ● Next.js (React framework with SSR)
│  ○ Expo (React Native framework)
│  ○ Hono (Fast web framework)
```

The stack determines the base template and available modules.

#### Module Selection

After selecting a stack, choose optional modules to include. Available modules depend on the selected framework:

**Next.js modules**:

```
◇  Do you want to add any Next.js modules to web?
│
│  UI & Styling
│  ◻ shadcn/ui - A set of beautifully designed components
│  ◻ Next Themes - A library for managing themes
│
│  Features
│  ◻ MDX - Markdown-based content
│  ◻ PWA - Progressive Web App support
│
│  Authentication
│  ◻ Better Auth - Comprehensive authentication framework
│
│  Data Fetching
│  ◻ TanStack Query - Asynchronous state management
│  ◻ TanStack Devtools - Devtools for TanStack libraries
│
│  Forms
│  ◻ React Hook Form - Performant form validation
│  ◻ TanStack Form - Headless form library
```

**Expo modules**:

```
◇  Do you want to add any Expo modules to mobile?
│
│  UI & Styling
│  ◻ NativeWind - Tailwind CSS for React Native
```

**Hono modules**:

```
◇  Do you want to add any Hono modules to api?
│
│  Cloud
│  ◻ AWS Lambda - Run on AWS Lambda
```

Modules are grouped by category for easier navigation. Use arrow keys to navigate and space to toggle selections.

</Step>

<Step>

### Database Selection

Choose a database provider or skip:

```
◇  Include a database?
│  ● PostgreSQL (Relational database)
│  ○ MySQL (Relational database)
│  ○ None
```

Selecting a database enables ORM selection in the next step. Database configuration is shared across all applications in a monorepo via the `packages/db` package.

</Step>

<Step>

### ORM Selection

If you selected a database, choose an ORM:

```
◇  Configure an ORM?
│  ● Drizzle (Lightweight TypeScript ORM)
│  ○ Prisma (Type-safe ORM with migrations)
│  ○ None
```

The ORM package includes:
- Type-safe database client
- Schema definitions
- Better Auth integration (if Better Auth module selected)
- Database connection configuration

</Step>

<Step>

### Git Initialization

Choose whether to initialize a Git repository:

```
◇  Initialize Git?
│  Yes / No (default: Yes)
```

If enabled, the CLI runs `git init` after file generation. This is required if you plan to use Husky for git hooks.

</Step>

<Step>

### Extras

Select additional development tools:

```
◇  Add any extras?
│  ◻ Biome - Fast linter & formatter
│  ◻ Husky - Git hooks for quality checks
```

**Biome**: Adds unified linting and formatting configuration across all apps.

**Husky**: Configures pre-commit hooks (requires Git to be initialized).

</Step>

<Step>

### Dependency Installation

Finally, choose whether to install dependencies immediately and which package manager to use:

```
◇  Install dependencies now?
│  ● Install with bun
│  ○ Install with pnpm
│  ○ Install with npm
│  ○ Skip installation
```

If you select a package manager, the CLI runs the installation process with a 5-minute timeout. If you skip, you can manually run the installation later:

```bash
cd my-saas
bun install
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Validation Rules

The CLI enforces compatibility requirements during configuration:

**ORM requires Database**: You cannot select an ORM without first selecting a database provider.

**Husky requires Git**: The Husky extra is only available if Git initialization is enabled.

**Unique app names**: In multi-app projects, each application must have a unique name.

If you make incompatible selections, the CLI displays an error message explaining the requirement.

## After Generation

Once the CLI completes, you'll see:

1. **Project structure**: A tree view of generated files and directories
2. **Auto-generated CLI command**: A copy-paste ready command to recreate the exact configuration
3. **Next steps**: Commands to navigate to your project and start development

Example output:

```
┌  Project structure
│
│  my-saas/
│  ├── apps/
│  │   ├── web/
│  │   ├── mobile/
│  │   └── api/
│  ├── packages/
│  │   └── db/
│  └── package.json
│
└

┌  Recreate this project
│
│  create-faster my-saas \
│    --app web:nextjs:shadcn,tanstack-query \
│    --app mobile:expo:nativewind \
│    --app api:hono \
│    --database postgres \
│    --orm drizzle \
│    --git \
│    --pm bun \
│    --extras biome,husky
│
└

Next steps:
  cd my-saas
  bun run dev
```

The auto-generated command allows you to share your exact configuration with team members or reproduce the project setup for testing.
