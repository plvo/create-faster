The interactive CLI provides a guided experience for creating projects. Run the command without any flags to start:

```bash
bunx create-faster
```

## Workflow Overview

The CLI walks through configuration in a logical sequence, starting with naming decisions, then application setup, followed by infrastructure choices, and finally installation preferences.

## Step-by-Step Process

<Steps>

<Step>

### Project Name

First, you'll name your project:

```bash
◇  Name of your project?
│  my-saas
```

The CLI validates that no file or directory with this name exists in the current directory. For single-app projects, this name becomes the application directory. For multi-app projects, it becomes the monorepo root.

</Step>

<Step>

### Application Count

Next, specify how many applications to create:

```bash
◇  How many apps do you want to create?
│  Eg: a backend + a frontend = enter 2
│  Only a Next.js app = enter 1
│  Turborepo will be used if more than one
│  3
```

**Single app (1)**: Generates a standard framework project structure.

**Multiple apps (2+)**: Automatically configures Turborepo with apps in `apps/` directory and shared packages in `packages/`.

</Step>

<Step>

### App Configuration

For each application, you'll configure its name, stack, and modules.

#### App Name

For single-app projects, the app name matches the project name automatically. For multi-app projects, you'll name each application:

```bash
◇  Name of the app #1?
│  web

◇  Name of the app #2?
│  mobile

◇  Name of the app #3?
│  api
```

#### Stack Selection

Choose the framework for each app. Stacks are organized by type:

```bash
◇  Select the stack for web
│
├ Web / Mobile App
│  ● Next.js (React framework with SSR)
│  ○ Expo (React Native framework)
│
└ Server / API
   ○ Hono (Fast web framework)
```

The stack determines the base template and available modules.

#### Module Selection

After selecting a stack, choose optional modules to include. Available modules depend on the selected framework and are grouped by category:

```bash
◇  Do you want to add any Next.js modules to web?
│
│  UI & Styling
│  ◻ shadcn/ui
│  ◻ Next Themes
│
│  Features
│  ◻ MDX
│  ◻ PWA
│
│  Authentication
│  ◻ Better Auth
│
│  Data Fetching
│  ◻ TanStack Query
│  ◻ TanStack Devtools
│
│  Forms
│  ◻ React Hook Form
│  ◻ TanStack Form
```

Use arrow keys to navigate and space to toggle selections.

</Step>

<Step>

### Database Selection

Choose a database provider or skip:

```bash
◇  Include a database?
│  ● PostgreSQL
│  ○ MySQL
│  ○ None
```

Selecting a database enables ORM selection in the next step. Database configuration is shared across all applications in a monorepo via the `packages/db` package.

</Step>

<Step>

### ORM Selection

If you selected a database, choose an ORM:

```bash
◇  Configure an ORM?
│  ● Drizzle
│  ○ Prisma
│  ○ None
```

The ORM package includes:
- Type-safe database client
- Schema definitions
- Authentication integration (if auth module selected)
- Database connection configuration

</Step>

<Step>

### Git Initialization

Choose whether to initialize a Git repository:

```bash
◇  Initialize Git?
│  Yes / No (default: Yes)
```

If enabled, the CLI runs `git init` after file generation. This is required if you plan to use Husky for git hooks.

</Step>

<Step>

### Extras

Select additional development tools:

```bash
◇  Add any extras?
│  ◻ Biome
│  ◻ Husky
```

**Biome**: Adds unified linting and formatting configuration across all apps.

**Husky**: Configures pre-commit hooks (requires Git to be initialized).

</Step>

<Step>

### Dependency Installation

Finally, choose whether to install dependencies immediately and which package manager to use:

```bash
◇  Install dependencies now?
│  ● Install with bun
│  ○ Install with pnpm
│  ○ Install with npm
│  ○ Skip installation
```

If you select a package manager, the CLI runs the installation process:

```bash
◆  Installing dependencies with bun...
│
◇  Dependencies installed successfully!
```

If you skip, you can manually run the installation later:

```bash
cd my-saas
bun install
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Validation Rules

The CLI enforces compatibility requirements during configuration:

**ORM requires Database**: You cannot select an ORM without first selecting a database provider.

**Husky requires Git**: The Husky extra is only available if Git initialization is enabled.

**Unique app names**: In multi-app projects, each application must have a unique name.

If you make incompatible selections, the CLI displays an error message explaining the requirement.

## After Generation

Once file generation completes, the CLI runs post-generation tasks if configured:

```bash
◆  Initializing git repository...
│
◇  Git repository initialized successfully!
```

Then displays a comprehensive summary with an auto-generated command to recreate the project:

```bash
