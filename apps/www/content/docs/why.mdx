## Core Benefits

### Time Savings

Starting a new project typically involves hours of configuration: setting up build tools, configuring linters, integrating authentication, connecting databases, and ensuring all dependencies work together. create-faster eliminates this repetitive work by providing pre-configured, tested integrations.

### Production-Ready Defaults

Every configuration choice in create-faster reflects production deployment requirements:

- Type-safe database access with supported ORMs
- Authentication framework integration
- Linting and formatting tools
- Git hooks for quality gates
- Optimized builds for all supported frameworks

### Integrated Multi-App Support

Complex applications often require multiple deployment targets: web frontends, mobile apps, and backend APIs. create-faster handles the orchestration complexity by automatically configuring Turborepo for shared code, coordinated builds, and unified dependency management.

### Automatic Monorepo Orchestration

When you create multiple apps, create-faster configures Turborepo automatically. No manual workspace setup, package linking, or build pipeline configuration required. The generated monorepo includes:

- Shared packages for database access and authentication
- Optimized task execution with caching
- Proper TypeScript project references
- Coordinated dependency versions

## Why Choose create-faster

create-faster addresses specific gaps in the current scaffolding tool ecosystem while maintaining flexibility and modern best practices.

### Key Differentiators

**Multi-App Architecture**: Native support for creating multiple applications simultaneously (web, mobile, server) with automatic monorepo configuration. No need to manually set up Turborepo or workspace linking.

**Automatic Orchestration**: When creating 2+ apps, Turborepo configuration happens automatically with proper caching, task pipelines, and shared package management.

**Framework Diversity**: Support for multiple frameworks across different application types. Not limited to single-ecosystem starters.

**Modular by Design**: Opt-in features per framework without forcing specific technology choices. Each stack has its own module system tailored to its ecosystem.

### Ideal Use Cases

create-faster is designed for:

- **SaaS applications** requiring web + mobile + API components in a single repository
- **Teams** needing consistent scaffolding across multiple project types
- **Production applications** with complex architecture requirements from day one
- **Projects** requiring framework flexibility and monorepo structure without manual configuration
- **Automated workflows** where reproducible project generation is essential

## Who Should Use create-faster

The tool is designed for developers who understand their stack choices but want to skip the configuration boilerplate and integration challenges.
