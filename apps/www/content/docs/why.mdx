title: Why create-faster
description: Benefits, philosophy, and how create-faster compares to alternatives

## Core Benefits

### Time Savings

Starting a new project typically involves hours of configuration: setting up build tools, configuring linters, integrating authentication, connecting databases, and ensuring all dependencies work together. create-faster eliminates this repetitive work by providing pre-configured, tested integrations.

### Production-Ready Defaults

Every configuration choice in create-faster reflects production deployment requirements:

- Type-safe database access with supported ORMs
- Authentication framework integration
- Linting and formatting tools
- Git hooks for quality gates
- Optimized builds for all supported frameworks

### Integrated Multi-App Support

Complex applications often require multiple deployment targets: web frontends, mobile apps, and backend APIs. create-faster handles the orchestration complexity by automatically configuring Turborepo for shared code, coordinated builds, and unified dependency management.

### Automatic Monorepo Orchestration

When you create multiple apps, create-faster configures Turborepo automatically. No manual workspace setup, package linking, or build pipeline configuration required. The generated monorepo includes:

- Shared packages for database access and authentication
- Optimized task execution with caching
- Proper TypeScript project references
- Coordinated dependency versions

## Why Choose create-faster

### vs create-t3-app

create-t3-app pioneered the concept of type-safe, opinionated starters for Next.js applications. create-faster builds on this philosophy while addressing different use cases:

**create-t3-app strengths**:
- Focused Next.js experience
- Deeply integrated tRPC + Next.js patterns
- Proven production usage at scale
- Strong community and documentation

**create-faster differentiators**:
- Multi-app support (web + mobile + server simultaneously)
- Automatic Turborepo configuration for monorepos
- Framework flexibility beyond single-framework starters
- Modular system with opt-in features per framework
- CLI flags for non-interactive automation

**Use create-t3-app when**: Building a single Next.js application with the opinionated T3 stack.

**Use create-faster when**: Creating multi-app projects requiring monorepo structure, or needing framework diversity across web, mobile, and server applications.

### vs better-t-stack

better-t-stack emphasizes minimalism and user choice with a "pick only what you need" philosophy.

**better-t-stack strengths**:
- Extreme modularity
- Wide framework support (including Remix, Solid, Svelte)
- Minimal template approach
- Transparent compatibility matrices

**create-faster differentiators**:
- Built-in multi-app workflow with automatic repo type selection
- Integrated module system per framework
- Unified stack selection interface
- Automatic Turborepo orchestration
- Auto-generated CLI command for reproducibility

**Use better-t-stack when**: Building a single app with maximum framework choice and minimal pre-configuration.

**Use create-faster when**: Building multi-app architectures or needing integrated module systems with framework-specific optimizations.

## Who Should Use create-faster

The tool is designed for developers who understand their stack choices but want to skip the configuration boilerplate and integration challenges.
