[Expo](https://expo.dev) is a production-ready framework for building native iOS and Android apps with React Native. It provides a complete development workflow from prototyping to deployment.

**Why use Expo?**
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reload, TypeScript support, and over-the-air updates
- **Native APIs**: Access to 50+ native modules (camera, location, notifications, etc.)
- **Cross-Platform**: Write once, run on iOS, Android, and web
- **EAS (Expo Application Services)**: Cloud build, submit, and update services
- **File-Based Routing**: Expo Router for type-safe navigation
- **No Native Code Required**: Build production apps without touching Swift/Kotlin

- Adds `tailwindcss` v3.3.2 as dev dependency
- Creates `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind configuration:
  - Content paths: `./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`
  - Preset: `require('nativewind/preset')`
- Creates `metro.config.js` - Metro bundler config with NativeWind transformer
- Creates `nativewind-env.d.ts` - TypeScript declaration file for NativeWind types
- Creates `styles/globals.css` - Global CSS entry point for Tailwind directives
