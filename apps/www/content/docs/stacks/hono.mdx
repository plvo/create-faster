## What create-faster adds

Beyond the official setup, we include:

**Pre-configured Middleware:**
- Logger middleware for request logging
- Timeout middleware (15s default)
- CORS middleware with wildcard origin and standard headers

**API Structure:**
- Health check endpoint (`/health/:id`) with JSON response
- Global error handler with dev/prod stack trace control
- 404 not found handler with JSON response
- Separation of concerns: `app.ts` (routes) and `index.ts` (entry point)

**Development Scripts:**
- `dev` - Hot reload development server (`bun run --hot`)
- `start` - Production server (`bun run src/index.ts`)

**Error Handling:**
- Global error handler with stack traces in development
- Structured JSON error responses
- Console logging for debugging
