## What create-faster adds

Beyond the official setup, we include:

**Pre-configured Middleware:**
- Logger middleware for request logging
- Timeout middleware (15s default)
- CORS middleware with wildcard origin and standard headers
- Zod validator for request validation

**API Structure:**
- Health check endpoint (`/health/:id`) with JSON response
- Global error handler with dev/prod stack trace control
- 404 not found handler with JSON response
- Separation of concerns: `app.ts` (routes) and `index.ts` (entry point)

**Development Scripts:**
- `dev` - Watch mode with hot reload (`bun run --watch`)
- `start` - Production server
- `build` - Compile to single ESM file with Bun

**Error Handling:**
- Global error handler with stack traces in development
- Structured JSON error responses
- Console logging for debugging
